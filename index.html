        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Manechat! Keep it family friendly and SFW. Breaking the rules will result in being muted, kicked, or banned. Fundamentally, our rules are mostly the same as the /r/mylittlepony subreddit rules, subject to moderator discretion.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Be pony-like and kind to other members.
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Trolling, impersonation, and similar acts are not acceptable!</li>
                <li>Follow common courtesy in voice chat. Keep it SFW, do not disturb in-progress games with off-topic chatter, and properly calibrate your microphone.</li>
                <li>Users that consistently create negative experiences for other users will be removed, even if no singular event would be considered severe.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            
            <li>No offensive/controversial/nsfw avatars, pictures, emotes, or topics. This means no politics or religion.</li>
            
            <li>All discussion, pictures, and any related content about the currently airing or next upcoming episode must be kept in the appropriately named spoiler channel (<span class="channel_name">#mlp-sXeXX</span>) until 48 hours after the <strong>end of the episode's Discovery Family airing</strong>, even if it may have leaked earlier. All other spoiler content goes in <span class="channel_name">#mlp-spoilers</span>.
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Do not carelessly spoil important plot points of any media <strong>in general</strong>, regardless of its age.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            
            <li>Shitposting, spamming, and low-effort memes are prohibited. Don’t use excessively illegible characters in usernames or text. Don’t use emotes more than four times as large as the subreddit emotes.
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Do not exercise excessive roleplay anywhere on the server. This is not the place for RP.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            
            <li>We are not a support group. If you need help, please visit the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlesupportgroup">My Little Support Group subreddit</a>, the <a href="https://discord.gg/0i3tTVbTo6cyvyPe">My Little Support Group Discord server</a> or contact a local professional in your area.

            </li>
            
            <li>Links to other Discord servers, patreons, gofundmes and similar are not allowed. This includes PMing members of the server with spam.
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Links to streams, channels, commissions and other self-promotion should be posted only once per 24 hours. (posting your own creations is exempt, but should not be spammed.)</li>
                <li>Please consider contacting a Princess if someone on the server, without asking for it, PMs you with links of advertisement, publicity, self-promotion or similar.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Do not enforce the rules or try to regulate behaviour, that is exclusively the princesses' responsibility. If you think or feel a rule is being breached, or you have concerns, PM a princess without worry.</p>
        
        <p><strong>All Princess decisions are final.</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Princesses have full discretion to remove content or users deemed unpleasant or unwelcomed by community members.</li>
                <li>Princesses have full discretion to change channel topics.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    
        <p>Respect <a href="https://discordapp.com/tos">Discord's Terms of Service</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Abusing or exploiting bugs in Sweetie Bot or Discord itself is a bannable offense.</p>

        <p>If you'd like to appeal a ban or otherwise communicate with the Princesses outside of Discord, you can <a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FManechatDiscord&subject=&message=">send a private message to us</a> on Reddit.</p>
